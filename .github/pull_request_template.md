# Milestone: 1
# Developer: Will Heath

### Pull Request Summary

All the criteria for Milestone 1 is met with some asterisks:

*Next.js is installed, so there is an imitation of js DOM manipulation in the
blog.ts file - it is marked as deprecated.

*Instead of a blog.html there is a /blog/page.tsx.

A blog page is still linked to the blogs array, but it is implemented through Next.js.
