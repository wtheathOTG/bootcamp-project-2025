                I am a freshman at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Since starting my programming journey in game development, I
                have learned the importance of user experience. It is imperative that an application interface is appealing, a
                concept that guided my artistic and architectural design decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I have progressed in data structures, algorithms, and system design I still prioritize maintaining ergonomic
                interfaces. As a team member, I hope to bridge the gap between backend design and user experience.
